    <h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
    <h5>Hi! I'm Syntyche!</h5>
    <p>My full name is Syntyche R. Carnaje (pronounced as "sin-ti-che"), but you can call me Syn.
    <p>I am a second-year IT 
        student at the University of Science and Technology of Southern Philippines. I completed my Senior High School education at 
        Liceo de Cagayan University, where I studied under the STEM strand. Although I have no prior experience in web development or 
        web design, I am eager to learn and explore these fields.</p>
    <p>I take pleasure in watching Korean dramas with my siblings and reading manhwas during my free time.</p>
